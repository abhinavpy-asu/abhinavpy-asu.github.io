## Updates
* July 2024 - I'm currently exploring how KANs (Kolmogorov Arnold Networks) can be useful to classify different image datasets, in particular road traffic-related images with [Dr. Bharathesh Chakravarthi](https://chakravarthi589.github.io/) as part of the [Active Perception Group](https://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/yezhouyang/).

## Research
My research interests fall in three macro-areas of computer science and engineering:
- generative ai
- novel neural network architectures
- distributed systems
