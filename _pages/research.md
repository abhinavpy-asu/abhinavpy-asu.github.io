## Updates
* July 2024 - I'm currently exploring how KANs (Kolmogorov Arnold Networks) can be useful to classify different image datasets, in particular traffic-related images.

## Research
My research interests fall in three macro-areas of computer science and engineering:
- generative ai
- novel neural network architectures
- distributed systems
