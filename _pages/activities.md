## Spitz Hill - Flagstaff, Arizona (21st - 23rd June 2024)
ARRL Field Day is an annual amateur radio contest, widely sponsored by IARU regions and member organizations, encouraging emergency communications preparedness among amateur radio operators. In the United States, it is typically the largest single emergency preparedness exercise in the country, with over 30,000 operators participating each year. We participated with the call-sign NS7F (of mentor Dr. Ross Tucker). I particularly communicated through the digital platform.
